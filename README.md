# Metadata Profile for Marine Plans
 
 A metadata profile for marine spatial plans in Europe

[HTML Version]()

## Objective

To agree and develop a metadata standard for the description of Marine Spatial Plans. This work needs to focus on the needs of end users in terms of discovery of marine spatial plans; governance (including monitoring) of marine spatial plans. The developed standard must be descriptive enough to capture sufficient information to meet these user needs, whilst not being too onerous for creators.
